## Interview Questions

### Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes.
My process began with analyzing the requirements and creating high-fidelity wireframes in Figma to establish the layout. During development, my biggest challenge was ensuring the images resized correctly without losing quality or Aspect Ratio. I overcame this by researching and implementing the HTML `<picture>` tag with `srcset`, allowing the browser to serve different image sizes based on the viewport width.

### What have you learned by creating this project?
I learned how to effectively combine the Bootstrap 5 framework with custom CSS variables to create a unique brand identity that doesn't look like a default Bootstrap site. I also gained experience in web accessibility, specifically implementing Skip Links and ARIA roles to assist screen reader users.
